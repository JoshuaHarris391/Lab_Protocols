# TRIzol Lysate Collection
- From adherent mammalian cell lines
- Protocol adapted from [Heather Cunliffe's Protocol](https://www.dropbox.com/s/38rdwdvrm8qjyam/Harvesting%20TRIZOL%20lysate%20from%20cultured%20adherent%20mammalian%20cell%20lines.docx?dl=0)

--------------------------------------------
- *Before starting, read the MSDS for TRIzol (liquid and fumes are a toxic hazard).*

### You will need:
  -	Access to a fume hood
  -	Biological waste disposal receptacle (e.g. falcon tube or glass flask)
  -	Aliquot of DPBS
  -	Stripette and liquid handler (size – see      table below)
  -	Pipette and pipette tips (size depends on size of harvest – see table below)
  -	Trizol dry waste container for discarded tips
  -	Eppendorf tube.

### Method:
  1.	Culture cells to 75-80% confluence
  1.	Transport all items above to a fume hood.
  1.	Transfer cells to fume hood.
  1.	Aspirate or decant media from cells into biological waste receptacle.
  1.	Referring to volumes in the table below, add DPBS to the side of the dish/flask and gently wash cell monolayer (20-30 seconds). Aspirate / decant the DPBS completely into the biological waste receptacle.
  1.	Referring to volumes in the table below, using a pipette and pipette tip, add TRIZol reagent directly onto the cells.  Take care not to touch the barrel of the pipette to the walls of the glass TRIzol bottle. Discard the tip into the dry trizol waste.
  1.	Tip and angle the dish/flask of cells ensuring the trizol touches the entire growth surface area. Cell lysis will be complete in ~30 seconds and will quickly become viscous.
  1.	Tip the dish/flask at an angle. Using a pipette and tip, homogenise the lysate gently and completely (4-5 mixes), then draw up lysate and transfer to an eppendorf tube. Discard tip in dry Trizol waste. Discard flask/dish in dry TRIzol waste bucket.
  1.	TRIzol lysate is stable at -20oC until needed.
