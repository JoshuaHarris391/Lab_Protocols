# Passaging cells from a 96 well plate to a 48 well plate
*Note: 20% FBS is in reference to EXP_84*

## Surface Area:
- 96 well = 0.36 cm2
- 48 well = 1.1 cm2

*Ratio of about 1:3*

1.  Pre-pipette 500uL of 20% FBS media into the wells of the 48 well plate
1.	Aspirate media
1.	Wash 96 well with 200uL PBS
1.	Add 50uL of Trypsin
1.	Add 300uL of 20% FBS media
    - Note, this is the same as 1:12 0.25% trypsin to 10% FBS
1.	Resuspend cells
1.	Transfer cells to 48 well plate
