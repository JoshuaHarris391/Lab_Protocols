# RIPA Lysate Collection

Author: Joshua Harris

--------------------------------------------
## Protocol:
1.	Make Protein Lysis Buffer with PI's. Keep on ice.
    *	40uL of PI per mL of RIPA
2.	Chill aliquot of PBS on ice
3.	Fast Cool centrifuge to 4 C.
4.	Label tubes and pre-chill on ice
    *	1.7mL Eppendorf - Lysate Collection
    *	Small Tube - BCA aliquot
    *	1.7mL Eppendorf - Supernatant Collection
5.	Aspirate off medium.
6.	Wash cells with 10mL of pre-chilled 1X DPBS.
7.	Aspirate off DPBS completely, removing as much liquid as possible.
8.	Place dish on ice.
9.	Add appropriate amount of Protein Lysis Buffer + PI's.

| Culture Dish/Flask |	Amount of Lysis Buffer |
| :----------------: | :---------------------: |
|100mm dish	         | 160uL                   |
|6-well dish	       | 200uL per 2 wells       |
|T-75 Flask	         | 500uL                   |

10.	Using a sterile cell scraper, spread buffer over entire surface of dish while scraping cells to detach and lyse.
11.	Tilt dish to a 45  angle and scrape lysate into a pool for easier removal.
12.	Pipette ~280 L of lysate from the dish into a 1.7mL tube. (Similar volumes will allow for centrifuge balance)
13.	Incubate samples on ice for 5min
14.	Centrifuge lysates at ~16,000g for 10 minutes at 4 C.
15.	Pipette the corresponding volumes of supernatant into the pre-chilled labeled tubes.
