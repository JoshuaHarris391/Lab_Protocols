# Transformation of DH5-alpha competent cells

### Transforming Competent Cells

[Original Protocol](https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/subcloningefficiencydh5alpha_man.pdf)

1. Thaw one tube of DH5α™ cells on ice and pre-chill 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes on wet ice.

2. Gently mix cells with the pipette tip and aliquot 50 µl of cells for
each transformation into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.

3. Refreeze any unused cells in the dry ice/ethanol bath for 5 minutes
**before** returning to the -80°C freezer. Do not use liquid nitrogen.

4. Add 1 to 5 µl (1-10 ng) of DNA to the cells and mix gently. Do not
mix by pipetting up and down. For the pUC19 control, add 2.5 µl
(250 pg) of DNA to the cells and mix gently.

5. Incubate tubes on ice for 30 minutes.

6. Heat shock cells for 20 seconds in a 42°C water bath without
shaking.

7. Place tubes on ice for 2 minutes.

8. Add 950 µl of pre-warmed medium of choice to each tube.

9. Incubate tubes at 37°C for 1 hour at 225 rpm.

10. Spread 20 µl to 200 µl from each transformation on pre-warmed
selective plates. We recommend plating two different volumes to
ensure that at least one plate will have well-spaced colonies. For
the pUC19 control, plate 100 µl on an LB plate containing
100 µg/ml ampicillin.

11. Store the remaining transformation reaction at +4°C. Additional
cells may be plated out the next day, if desired.

12. Incubate plates overnight at 37°C.
Using DH5α™ as a Transient Host
To use the DH5α™ strain as a transient host, follow the transformation
protocol provided on the previous page with the following changes:
  - Since antibiotic selection is not necessary for plaque formation,
recovery medium and recovery time at 37°C for 1 hour is not
required.
  - Add a lawn of E. coli containing the F episome (e.g. DH5α-FT™,
DH5αF'™, DH5αF'IQ™) to the top agar.
  - Add X-gal or Bluo-Gal to the top agar to a final concentration of
50 µg/ml and IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM.
  - Add the transformation reaction to the top agar after lawn cells,
IPTG, and X-gal or Bluo-gal have been added.


### General Guidelines
Follow these guidelines when using Subcloning Efficiency™ DH5α™
competent E. coli.

-  Handle competent cells gently as they are highly sensitive to changes
in temperature or mechanical lysis caused by pipetting.
- Thaw competent cells on ice, and transform cells immediately
following thawing. After adding DNA, mix by swirling or tapping
the tube gently. Do not mix cells by pipetting.
- DH5α™ cells do not require IPTG to induce expression from the lac
promoter. To select transformants using blue/white screening, make
sure that selective plates contain 50 µg/ml X-gal.
