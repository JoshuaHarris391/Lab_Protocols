# Making Calcium Competent Cells
## Day 1
1. Streak out frozen glycerol stock of bacterial cells (Top10, DH5α, etc.) onto an LB
plate.
    - No antibiotics since these cells do not have a plasmid in them
    - Work sterile
    - Grow plate overnight at 37°C.

## Day 2

#### 1. Autoclave:
- 1L LB (or your preferred media)
- 1L of 100 mM CaCl2
- 1L of 100 mM MgCl2
- 100 mL of 85 mM CaCl2, 15% glycerol v/v
- 1L culture flasks


#### 2. Chill overnight at 4°C:
- 100 mM CaCl2
- 100 mM MgCl2
- 85 mM CaCl2, 15% glycerol v/v
- Centrifuge rotor


#### 3. Prepare starter culture of cells
- Select a single colony of E. coli from fresh LB plate and inoculate a 10 mL starter culture of LB (or your preferred media – no antibiotics).
- Grow culture at 37°C in shaker overnight.


> ##### Notes:
> - You will have extra CaCl2 and MgCl2
> - These solutions can be saved and re-autoclaved for the > next time you make competent cells.
> - You can also substitute other media like SOB, 2xYT, etc. > for the LB if you prefer.
> - All glassware should be detergent free. Presence of > detergent reduces competency of cells.

## Day 3
1. Inoculate 300 mL of LB media with 3 mL starter culture and grow in 37°C shaker.
1. Measure the OD600 every hour
    - Then every 15-20 minutes when the OD gets above 0.2.
1. When the OD600 reaches 0.35-0.4, immediately put the cells on ice.
1. Chill the culture for 20-30 minutes, swirling occasionally to ensure even cooling.
    - Place centrifuge bottles on ice at this time.


> ##### Important Notes:
> - It is important not to let the OD get any higher than 0.4.
> - The OD should be carefully monitored and checked often, > especially when it gets above 0.2, as the cells grow > exponentially.
> - It usually takes about 3 hours to reach an OD of 0.35
> when using a 10 mL starter culture.
> - It is also very important to keep the cells at 4°C for the > remainder of the procedure.
> - The cells and any bottles or solutions that they come in > contact with must be pre-chilled to 4°C.


5. **Spin 1** - Split the 300 mL culture into six parts by pouring 50 mL into ice cold centrifuge bottles.
1. Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 3000g for 15 minutes at 4°C.
1. Decant the supernatant and gently resuspend each pellet in 2 0 mL of ice cold MgCl2



1. **Spin 2** - Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 2000g for 15 minutes at 4°C.
1. Decant the supernatant and resuspend each pellet in about 10 mL of ice cold CaCl2
    - Keep this suspension on ice for at least 20 minutes
    - Start putting 1.5 mL micro-centrifuge tubes on ice if not already chilled.

1. Combine suspensions into two 50 mL centrifuge tubes, to make two suspensions of 30mL each.

1. **Spin 3** - Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 2000g for 15 minutes at 4°C.
    - At this step, rinse a 50 mL conical tube with ddH2O and chill on ice.
1. Decant the supernatant and resuspend each pellet in 7.5 mL of ice cold 85 mM CaCl2, 15% glycerol.
1. Combine pellets into a single 50mL centrifuge tube to make a 15mL suspension
1. **Spin 4** - Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 1000g for 15 minutes at 4°C.
1. Decant the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 0.6 mL of ice cold 85 mM CaCl2, 15% glycerol.
    - The final OD600 of the suspended cells should be ~ 200-250.
1. Aliquot 50 μL into sterile 1.5 mL microfuge tubes and snap freeze with liquid nitrogen or dry ice in an ethanol bath.
1. Store frozen cells in the -80°C freezer.
