# Preparation of Chemically Competent E.coli – Inoue Buffer (IB) method.

*[Adapted protocol](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ld88shl17z3z7un/Preparation%20of%20Chemically%20Competent%20E.coli%20020419.docx?dl=0) originally made by Heather Cunliffe*

This protocol is based on the [Calcium CaCl2 and MgCl2 method](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qhlpymmuksr1onk/calcium_competent_E.coli.pdf?dl=0) but uses Inoue transformation buffer (IB) instead, for higher-efficiency results.
250mL bacterial culture will yield 1mL of competent cells (20 x 50uL aliquots).

#### You will need:

- 40-50mL sterile centrifuge tubes (e.g. Beckman JA-17 rotor)
- 500mL-1L sterile conical flask
- Shaking 37oC incubator
- OD600-capable spectrophotometer and spectrophotometer
- cuvettes
- Ice-cold (0oC) Inoue Buffer (IB)
- Ice-cold IB containing 15% v/v glycerol

## Method:
1.	Prepare a fresh overnight culture of desired strain grown in 5mL Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or similar.
1. Subculture a 5mL starter culture  overnight
1. Transfer 2.5mL of starter culture into 250mL of LB to begin a growth culture (supersize by putting 10mL of starter into 1L of LB).
1.	Grow at 37oC with vigorous shaking. Measure the OD600 every hour until OD600 reaches 0.2. then every 15-20 minutes until OD600 = 0.4
1.	Chill the culture in ice for 20-30 minutes, swirling occasionally to ensure even cooling. Place centrifuge tubes on ice to cool.


#### Important notes:
-  It is important not to let the OD600 get any higher than 0.4.
- The OD should be carefully monitored and checked often, as the cells grow exponentially.
- It usually takes about 3 hours to reach an OD of 0.35
- It is also very important to keep the cells at 4°C for the remainder of the procedure.
- The cells, and any bottles or solutions that they come in contact with must be pre-chilled to 4°C.


6.	Aliquot 50mL of bacterial culture into X5 50mL canonical tubes. Also make a 50mL tube with water to act as a balance.
1.	**Spin 1:** Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 3000 g (~4000 rpm in the Beckman JA-10 rotor) for 15 minutes at 4°C
1.	Decant the supernatant and gently resuspend each pellet (in 50mL tube) in 20 mL of ice cold IB.
    - Create a 20mL balance tube
1.	**Spin 2:** Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 2000 g (~3000 rpm in the Beckman JA-10 rotor) for 15 minutes at 4°C
1.	Decant the supernatant and gently resuspend each pellet in 10 mL of ice cold IB.
    -	Then combine resuspended pellets into one tube to make a single 50mL suspension
    -	Keep this suspension on ice for 20 min – 1h.
1.	**Spin 3:** Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 2000 g (~3000 rpm in the Beckman JA-10 rotor) for 15 minutes at 4°C
1.	Decant the supernatant and gently resuspend pellet in 12.5 mL of ice cold IB with 15% glycerol.
    - Create a 12.5mL balance
1.	**Spin 4:** Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 1000 g for 15 minutes at 4°C
1.	Decant the supernatant and gently resuspend pellet in 1 mL of ice cold IB with 15% glycerol.
    - The final OD600 of the suspended cells should be ~100-125 (Don’t really need to check)
1.	Aliquot 100 μL into sterile 1.5 mL microfuge tubes and snap freeze with liquid nitrogen or dry ice-ethanol bath. Store frozen cells in the -80°C freezer.

## Inoue Buffer:  

Prepare buffer and chill to 0 °C (ice slurry) before use.

### Innoe Transformation buffer [final]	1L
- 55mM MnCl2	(10.88g)
- 15mM CaCl2	(2.20g)
- 250mM KCl	(18.65g)
- 10mM PIPES 	(20mL of 0.5M, pH 6.7 stock solution)
- H2O	To 1L

#### Buffer preparation:  
Organic contaminants in the H2O used to prepare transformation buffers can reduce the efficiency of transformation of competent bacteria. H2O obtained directly from a well-serviced Milli-Q filtration system usually gives good results. If problems should arise, treat the deionized H2O with activated charcoal before use.


1. Prepare 0.5 M PIPES (pH 6.7). Adjust the pH of the solution to 6.7 with 5 M KOH, and then add pure H2O to bring the final volume to 100 ml.
    - Sterilize the solution by filtration through a disposable prerinsed Nalgene filter.
    - Divide into aliquots and store frozen at -20 °C
1. Prepare Inoue transformation buffer by dissolving all of the solutes listed below in 800 ml of pure H2O and then add 20 ml of 0.5 M PIPES (pH 6.7).
    - 55mM MnCl2	(10.88g)
    - 15mM CaCl2	(2.20g)
    - 250mM KCl	(18.65g)
1. Adjust the volume of the Inoue transformation buffer to 1 liter with pure H2O.
1. Sterilize Inoue transformation buffer by filtration through a pre-rinsed 0.45-mm Nalgene filter. Divide into aliquots and store at -20 °C
