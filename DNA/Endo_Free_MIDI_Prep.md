--------------------------------------------------------------
1.	Pick a single colony from a freshly streaked selective plate and inoculate a starter culture of 2-5 ml LB medium containing the appropriate selective antibiotic. Incubate for ~8 hours at 37 C with vigorous shaking (~300 rpm).  

1. Dilute the starter culture 1/500 to 1/1000 into selective LB medium. For high-copy plasmids inoculate 25 ml medium, and for low-copy plasmids, inoculate 50 ml medium. Grow at 37 C for 12-16 hours with vigorous shaking (~300 rpm).  

1.	Harvest the bacterial cells by centrifugation at 6000 x g for 15 min at 4 C.  

1.	Resuspend the bacterial pellet in 4 ml Buffer P1. Ensure that RNase A has been added to Buffer P1. The bacteria should be resuspended completely by vortexing or pipetting up and down until no cell clumps remain.

1.	Add 4 ml Buffer P2, mix gently but thoroughly by inverting 4-6 times, and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.
    1.	Do not vortex, as this will result in shearing of genomic DNA. The lysate should appear viscous. Do not allow the lysis reaction to proceed more than 5 min.  During the incubation prepare the QIAfilter Cartridge:  Screw the cap onto the outlet nozzle of the QIAfilter Midi Cartridge to prevent dripping. Place the QIAfilter Cartridge into a convenient tube.  

1.	Add 4 ml chilled Buffer P3 to the lysate, and mix immediately but gently by inverting 4-6 times. Proceed directly to step 7. Do not incubate the lysate on ice.  

1.	Pour the lysate into the barrel of the QIAfilter Cartridge. Incubate at room temperature for 10 min. Do not insert the plunger.  

    1.	Important: This 10 min incubation at room temperature is essential for optimal performance of the QIAfilter Midi Cartridge. Do not agitate the QIAfilter Cartridge during this time.  

1.	Remove the cap from the QIAfilter outlet nozzle. Gently insert the plunger into the QIAfilter Midi Cartridge and filter the cell lysate into a convenient tube (50mL Falcon).

1.	Add 1ml (0.1 volumes) Buffer ER (Endotoxin Free) to the filtered lysate, mix by inverting the tube approximately 10 times, and incubate on ice for 30 min.  

1.	After the addition of Buffer ER (endotoxin free) the lysate appears turbid, but will become clear again during the incubation on ice.  

1.	Equilibrate a QIAGEN-tip 100 by applying 4 ml Buffer QBT (endotoxin free), and allow the column to empty by gravity flow.  

1.	Apply the cleared lysate from step 9 to the QIAGEN-tip and allow it to enter the resin by gravity flow.
a.	Note: All subsequent steps have to be performed with endotoxin-free buffers and materials. Please make sure to only use the wash and elution buffers provided with the EndoFree Plasmid Kit or EndoFree Buffer Set.  

1.	Wash the QIAGEN-tip with 2 x 10 ml Buffer QC (Endotoxin Free).  

1.	Elute DNA with 5 ml Buffer QN (Endotoxin Free).
a.	Collect the elute in a 10 ml endotoxin-free tube. Use of polycarbonate centrifuge tubes for collection is not recommended as polycarbonate is not resistant to the alcohol used in subsequent steps.

1.	Precipitate DNA by adding 3.5 ml (0.7 volumes) room-temperature isopropanol to the eluted DNA. Mix then split the 8.5mL resulting solution of eluted DNA/isopropanol into x5 1.7mL Eppendorf tubes (necessary if you do not have a 15,000g centrifuge at 4 degrees)

17.	Centrifuge immediately at ≥15,000 x g for 30 min at 4 C.  

1. Using a transfer pipette, combine all pellets together, then re-spin at ≥15,000 x g for 10min.

   * Make sure tubes are balanced in the centrifuge

1.	Wash DNA pellet with 1ml of endotoxin-free room-temperature 70% ethanol (do not need to resuspend) and centrifuge at ≥15,000 x g for 10 min.  

1.	Remove ethanol and repeat pellet washing with another 1mL 70% ethanol (Endotoxin Free).

1.	Centrifuge at ≥15,000 x g for 5 min. Carefully decant the supernatant as much as you can.

1.	Air dry pellet, it will go from white to transparent in colour

1.	Add 30-50uL of TE (endotoxin free) to the pellet, resuspend by flicking the tube. (Not by pipetting or vortexing)

1.	Allow 1-2hrs for DNA to go into solution

1.	Store at -20dC

1.	Spec DNA to determine concentration (may need to dilute 1:10 or even 1:50)
