1. Pellet 1ml of bacterial overnight culture by centrifugation at 6800xg for 3 min at room temperature (15–25°C).

1. Remove supernatant, add another 1mL of bacterial culture, then centrifuge again.

1. Resuspend pelleted bacterial cells in 250 μl Buffer P1 and transfer to a
microcentrifuge tube.

1. Add 250 μl Buffer P2 and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube
4–6 times until the solution becomes clear. Do not allow the lysis reaction to
proceed for more than 5 min.

1. Add 350 μl Buffer N3 and mix immediately and thoroughly by inverting the tube
4–6 times.

1. Centrifuge for 10 min at 17,900xg in a table-top
microcentrifuge.

1. Apply the supernatant from step 5 to the QIAprep spin column by decanting or
pipetting.
  - Centrifuge for 30–60 s and discard the flow-through

1. Recommended: Wash the QIAprep spin column by adding 0.5 ml Buffer PB.
  - Centrifuge for 30–60 s and discard the flow-through
  - Note: This step is only required when using endA+ strains or other bacteria
  strains with high nuclease activity or carbohydrate content.

1. Wash the QIAprep spin column by adding 0.75 ml Buffer PE.
  - Centrifuge for 30–60 s and discard the flow-through

1. Centrifuge for 1 min to remove residual wash buffer.

1. Place the QIAprep column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.

1. To elute DNA,
add 50 μl Buffer EB (10 mM Tris·Cl, pH 8.5) or water to the center of the
QIAprep spin column, let stand for 1 min, and centrifuge for 1 min.
