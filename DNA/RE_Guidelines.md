# Restriction Enzyme Guidelines / Protocol

*Author: Joshua Harris*

------------------------------------------
#### Considerations / Guidelines

- Digest 100-200ng plasmid DNA in a final volume of 20uL

- Volume of plasmid preparation (typically containing 1mM EDTA) must not exceed 10% of the final digestion reaction final volume.

- Enzymes are typically 10 units/uL.
  - But could be more, so check the tube

- 1 Unit(U) of enzyme cuts 1ug of DNA in 1h (at the enzymes optimal temperature and buffer pH).
  - BUT we always 10-fold over digest.  i.e. use 10U per 1ug.

- If enzyme has star activity, digest for the minimum required time (~1h).

- Remember : enzymes are in glycerol, so don't add more than 10% of the restriction digest final volume (max 10% enzyme)

- Set up an identical reaction, but without the enzyme, to run as an 'undigested DNA' control.

-------------------------------------------------

#### Digestion set up (20uL total):  
*Exemplar:*

- 0.5uL plasmid DNA (200ng)
- 2uL 10X buffer matching your restriction enzyme
- 0.5uL Enzyme (if it is 10 U/uL)
- 17uL sterile distilled H2O

-------------------------------------------------

#### Protocol

1. Digest for 1h at enzyme's specified temperature
   - Set up reaction in PCR tubes


1. Add 2.2uL 10X DNA loading dye.  
   - This will stop the enzyme reaction.
   - Alternatively you can heat inactivate most enzymes - see product info.

1. Pour an Agarose gel (with Ethidium Bromide) with a 10uL well comb.
   - Agarose percentage will depend on what you want to resolve

1. Once set, submerge in 1X TAE

1. Load 5uL of 1KB plus DNA ladder

1. Load 10uL of the reaction mix (including stop buffer / DNA loading buffer) into one well.

1. Load 10uL of undigested reaction into another well.

1. Electrophorese at ~100cV for 30-60min
   - Run till Bromophenol blue dye front is 2/3 to Â¾ down the length of the gel

1. Stop electrophoresis, and image using the gel doc.
