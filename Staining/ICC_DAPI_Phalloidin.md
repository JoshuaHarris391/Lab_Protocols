# Staining PFA fixed cells with DAPI and Phalloidin-568
- Phalloidin-568 (200 units/ml). Note, 1 unit (5ul) is sufficient to stain 1 microscope slide

#### DAPI stock details:
Stock solution once reconstituted is 14.3mM (5mg/ml) in H20. Stock solution stable for 6 months at 2-6oC or at -20oC for longer periods.  Prepare a 1000X working stock solution of 300uM DAPI (1000 X) by diluting 2.1ul of 14.3mM DAPI in 100ul PBS. Store as above. Dilute 300uM DAPI 1:1000 in PBS to make 300nM.


## Staining with DAPI
1.	After fixing cells, add 250uL of 300nM DAPI in PBS per chamber slide well (4 well)
1. Incubate 1-5 min protected from the light.
1. Remove DAPI
1. Wash cells twice with PBS
1. Protect from light.  


## Staining with Phalloidin-568:
1. After fixing cells, Add 250uL of phalloidin-568 in PBS.  
1. Cover with foil.  
1. Wait 5 minutes.
1. Remove Phalloidin solution using a p1000
1. Discard residual Phalloidin in 1.5ml eppendorf
1. Wash cells twice with PBS
1. Protect from light.
