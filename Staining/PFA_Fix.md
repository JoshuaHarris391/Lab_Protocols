# Fixing cells with PFA

## Making 4% PFA

PFA is toxic. Do not breathe powder. Discard into a dedicated waste container. Make a 4% solution in 1X PBS. Heat to 65oC to help dissolve powder (mix often). Add about 5ul 10M NaOH to assist dissolving 4g PFA in 100ml. Freeze in 5ml aliquots in 15ml Falcon tubes, at â€“20oC. Thaw out and store at 4oC for 1-2 weeks only.
